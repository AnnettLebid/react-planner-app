# react-planner-app
This as an app that will let you add elements to a ‘to do’ list and to move it from that list to a ‘done’. This app needs to be created using React and create-react-app. 
The application has such extra features: delete post, star post (takes it to the top). When clicking on the tick button, it moves the post from ’To do’ to ‘done’ and vice versa.
